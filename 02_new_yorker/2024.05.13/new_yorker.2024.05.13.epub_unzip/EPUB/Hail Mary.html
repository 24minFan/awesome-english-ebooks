<p>As in Hello, which is as good as any beginning.<br/>
A pouty look, a flirty look, how should one<br/>
look? To be the queen of anything<br/>
isn’t easy. What is easy? You have got this,<br/>
is frequently said. Frequently recently.<br/>
To be favored, to have grace bestowed upon<br/>
when everyone in the Book of Hours is busy<br/>
contorting themselves to make sense<br/>
of what it feels like to be in the light. You are<br/>
right, we’re moving from sea to shining sea<br/>
across the stolen broken land, stricken with<br/>
a grief that knows no bounds and yet singing<br/>
and saying, “Let’s wake one more day in order<br/>
to confirm that there was a moment yesterday<br/>
when we were one.” That’s right, all these<br/>
theatrics—for which one pays with their body.</p></div>
